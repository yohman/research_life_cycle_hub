As large-scale data analysis is often limited to most bioscience laboratories, the Collaboratory\u2019s main mission is to facilitate genomic data analysis by bringing together UCLA bioscience faculty with a select group of QCB post-doctoral fellows dedicated to the Collaboratory. Individual post-doctoral fellows are assigned to work on specific bioscience research projects to develop and implement tailored methodologies for genomic analysis. In addition, the fellows are responsible for organizing intensive tutorials to train UCLA students and postdocs in the latest next-generation sequence analysis techniques. The Collaboratory has also set up and maintains a next-generation sequence data analysis server.","id":7,"name":"Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences","url":"https://qcb.ucla.edu/"},{"acronym":"IDRE","color":"#666699","created_at":"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 18:04:29 GMT","description":"DRE supports research and innovative scholarship that takes advantage of new technologies and encourages collaboration between faculty from different departments and disciplines at UCLA, the opening of new research questions, and the enrichment of the learning environment.
