This section designates support for conceptualizing and scoping of research projects are provided by the Library Data Science Center, IDRE, local resources from various departmental and divisional IT staff, and “peers,” defined as other faculty members conducting similar research. The planning phase is supplemented with early-stage research support including “Literature review and landscape scan,” “Workshops and trainings,” “Tools and best practices,” “Data models and structures,” “Prototyping,” “Ethics, compliance and security,” and “Project management guidance” which are largely supported by the Library Data Science Center, IDRE, and the Scholarly Innovations Lab.",1,Plan,100

It is complemented by additional stations that support various phases of conducting the research agenda. Some funded projects require a data plan, where “Data management plan,” “Data collection and manipulation” are supported by the Data Science Center and IDRE. With an attempt to cover the vast spectrum of computation activities that enables research, different computational processes and methodologies are supported: “Advanced computation,” “Statistical analysis,” “Data visualization,” “GIS and mapping,” “3D, VR and AR technologies,” and “Text analysis.”
