QCBio,#66cc99,2020-03-05 09:11:49+00:00,"The Collaboratory, a central component of the Institute for Quantitative & Computational Biosciences (QCB), provides the experimental and empirical research environment where bioscientists and computational scientists work together to design and conduct experiments to improve our understanding of biological systems. As large-scale data analysis is often limited to most bioscience laboratories, the Collaboratoryâ€™s main mission is to facilitate genomic data analysis by bringing together UCLA bioscience faculty with a select group of QCB post-doctoral fellows dedicated to the Collaboratory. Individual post-doctoral fellows are assigned to work on specific bioscience research projects to develop and implement tailored methodologies for genomic analysis. In addition, the fellows are responsible for organizing intensive tutorials to train UCLA students and postdocs in the latest next-generation sequence analysis techniques. The Collaboratory has also set up and maintains a next-generation sequence data analysis server.",7,Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences,https://qcb.ucla.edu/
